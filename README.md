People were asking for models, which is a hard thing to do. Heres one mod you where you can switch to the Me 262 model now.

I made it so it adds the same jets also for Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and British Raj.
Im aware that for instance "Gloster Meteor" wasnt used by all those Nations, only New Zealand and Australia for instance.
But its better than having the default ones i guess. Maybe i find a better way in the future.
